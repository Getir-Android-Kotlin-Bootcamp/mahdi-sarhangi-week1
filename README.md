## Getir Bootcamp with Patika / Kotlin Homework Week I

This repository contains the homework assignments and solutions for my participation in the Getir Bootcamp with Patika focused on Kotlin programming.

**Key Concepts Covered**

* Kotlin Basics (syntax, variables, data types)
* Control Flow (conditionals, loops)
* Functions
* Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces)
* Data Structures (lists, sets, maps)
* Null Safety
* Working with Collections (filtering, mapping, sorting)
* Advanced Topics (generics, extension functions, operator overloading)

**About**

This project serves to demonstrate my knowledge and proficiency in Kotlin programming concepts while also acting as a reference guide for future learning.

**Additional Notes**

* I've included extensive comments throughout the code to explain my thought process and implementation choices.

I hope this project helps others along their Kotlin learning journey or is helpful as an example of bootcamp/educational work.
